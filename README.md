# Hello World, I'm Jas Sharma! üë®‚Äçüíª

## üöÄ About Me
I'm Jas Sharma, an aspiring technologist pursuing a B.Tech in Robotics and Automation at the University of School of Automation and Robotics. My academic voyage is a quest to blend the physical prowess of robotics with the cognitive prowess of artificial intelligence.

### üíº My Interests
I'm deeply enthralled by the potential of robotics and machine learning to revolutionize the way we interact with the world around us. From autonomous vehicles to smart cities, my interest lies in the heart of innovation where technology serves as a bridge to a sustainable future.

### üõ†Ô∏è Skills and Expertise
My toolkit is a tapestry of programming languages and frameworks designed to tackle the complexities of:
- **Machine Learning (ML)**: Crafting algorithms that predict and analyze with precision.
- **Deep Learning (DL)**: Architecting neural networks that mimic the intricacies of human cognition.
- **Data Analytics**: Interpreting vast datasets to unearth actionable insights using R and Python.
